# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: January 11, 2019

**Today's Task**: Spent time on CSS via #DailyCSSImages. First exposure so scss and using variable names in preprocessor. 

**Thoughts:**: Learned about various masking techniques and, importantly, creative thinking to accommodate limitations of the language. For example, masking out the brain: initially tried to mask out the head and then adding the brain. Better approach was to apply mask border to brain.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
